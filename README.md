A REST-API interface for ArubaOS 8.x based networks.
====================================================

This is a small python3-based API-caller for the ArubaOS 8.x REST-API. It isn't pretty and more a proof of concept than a full-fetured library. Its purpose is to give people an idea of how to interact with the ArubaOS 8.x REST-API in python3.

Introduction to the API itself and this library can be found here: https://linux-nerds.de/2018/03/14/managing-an-arubaos-8-x-setup-through-the-api-in-python/
